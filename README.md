# UntitledGame
This is the repo for the 2D RPG game I am currently working on in C++/OpenGL.

## Libraries
The libraries I will be using for this project include GLFW (Window, I/O for mouse and keyboard and controllers), GLAD (Core OpenGL profile usage), IrrKlang (2D and 3D Audio) and GLM (OpenGL Maths library for linear algebra)

## Setup
All you need to do is create a folder called "OutputDir" in the same folder that you've cloned the repo to, and then place the DLL files stored at "Dependencies/DLLs" in there. Everything else is done for you :)
